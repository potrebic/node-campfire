This code isn't in a released state yet.

>This is my first node.js project. This package will be used in another project that I'm working on - [Smoke Signal](https://github.com/potrebic/smokesignal). I wrote the first version of smoke Signal in C#/.Net, and rewriting it in node as a learning experience
